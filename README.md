# week2-homework

The website contains three pages:
    index.html (About Me)
    portfolio.hmtl
    contact.html

The website is functional.

The navbar is consistent across the three pages and contains working links to each page.

The website uses semantic html where possible.

The webesite contains Graham Elphick's personalised information.

The website utilises Bootsrap components and the grid system for layout and responsiveness.

The three html files have been validated by https://validator.w3.org/ : see screenshots in "html-validation-proof" folder.
